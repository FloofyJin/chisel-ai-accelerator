Chisel Project Template
=======================

### Dependencies

#### JDK 8 or newer

We recommend LTS releases Java 8 and Java 11. You can install the JDK as recommended by your operating system, or use the prebuilt binaries from [AdoptOpenJDK](https://adoptopenjdk.net/).

#### SBT or mill

SBT is the most common built tool in the Scala community. You can download it [here](https://www.scala-sbt.org/download.html).

### It worked!

You are ready to go. We have a few recommended practices and things to do.

* Use packages and following conventions for [structure](https://www.scala-sbt.org/1.x/docs/Directories.html) and [naming](http://docs.scala-lang.org/style/naming-conventions.html)
* Package names should be clearly reflected in the testing hierarchy
* Build tests for all your work
* Read more about testing in SBT in the [SBT docs](https://www.scala-sbt.org/1.x/docs/Testing.html)
* This template includes a [test dependency](https://www.scala-sbt.org/1.x/docs/Library-Dependencies.html#Per-configuration+dependencies) on [chiseltest](https://github.com/ucb-bar/chisel-testers2), this is a reasonable starting point for most tests
  * You can remove this dependency in the build.sbt file if you want to
* Change the name of your project in the build.sbt file
* Change your README.md
